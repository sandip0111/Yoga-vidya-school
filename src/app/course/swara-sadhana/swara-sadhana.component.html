          <p>
            This workshop delves into the ancient sciences of pranic body
            rhythms, elucidating the ways in which the flow of Prana can be
            regulated through breath control. While this knowledge is currently
            preserved by a select group of practitioners in India, under the
            guidance of yogacharya Prashant, participants will have the
            opportunity to explore and comprehend the intricacies of this
            profound science.this science was previously practised by many
            tantrik tradition, but in initiation was only given by direct
            transmission or by word of mouth from Guru to disciples. Therefore,
            our upcoming workshop is designed in such a way where Prashant ji
            will be teaching you how to understand the energy body and how your
            actions are manipulated with this energy.

            The meaning of swara is ‚ÄúThe sound of one‚Äôs own breath
          </h4>
          <p>
            It means learning the call of your breath in order to understand the
            behaviour of your energy body and connect this with your day-to-day
            action, whether it is mental or physical. But you should not be
            confused the science with Pranayama, which involves a different
            aspect of the breath, although these both signs deals with prana and
            swara yoga may therefore be said to involve the practices of
            Pranayam, but in the fact, it is a much more expensive and precious
            science Promote the Swara tradition - The Swara science is
            intricately linked to the Tantrik tradition, in which Lord Shiva is
            revered as adinath (the original guru) who first imparted the
            knowledge of Swara to his disciple, Parvati. According to Swara
            Shastra, a profound understanding of the cosmos is unveiled through
            the analysis of breath, allowing for the realization of the wisdom
            contained within the Vedas. A practitioner can attain the status of
            a perfected yogi by diligently practicing this science.
