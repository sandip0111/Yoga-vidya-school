            Yoga started in my life from Shivananda Yoga Ashram, when I was only
            17 years old. At that time I joined the yoga classes only for
            physical health. But there is a saying that if at any time you
            engage yourself dedicatedly in spiritual activities, your whole body
            and mind continue to motivate you to go in the right direction. This
            is what happened to me. During my practices at Sivananda, I was in
            numerous thoughts and life was progressing towards spirituality. I
            learnt Iyengar Yoga at Shivananda Ashram for two years and then I
            chose the way for Satyananda Yoga Institution in Bihar (first yoga
            university in India).

            I completed my graduation while staying at Shivananda Ashram. Since
            I done my graduation with Biology, it has further increased my
            relationship with Yoga, especially the anatomy and how it affects
            the deeper body, mind and emotions. As soon as I finished my
            established studies I went to Bihar School of Yoga in 2012 where I
            practiced Karma Yoga, and that was a turning point of my life. From
            here I gave the right direction to my life and made yoga as my
            ultimate aim. I met my first yogini guru - Swamini Satsangini ji
            from whom I took Diksha and entered into a deeper yogic life.

            After one year of practicing in Bihar Yoga Institute and receiving
            the instructor letter I came back to Rishikesh for my post
            graduatation. As it was already cleared in my mind, when I was in
            Bihar school of Yoga, so I continued my post-graduation in the field
            of Yoga at Uttarakhand Sanskriti University. On the side, I was also
            exploring the ancient texts and vedic practice with scholars at
            various Ashrams like Kailash Ashram in Rishikesh. While pursuing my
            postgraduate degree, I was introduced to Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga by
            Saraswathi Jois (daughter of K. Pattabhi Jois, father of Ashtanga
            Vinyasa Yoga). She became my second guru, who taught me Ashtanga
            vinyasa in Mysore, the place I visit regularly for my practice. My
            past journey and experience in Yoga motivated me to do PhD in Yoga.

            After coming from Bihar school of Yoga, I started teaching drop-in
            classes in Rishikesh and started sharing my experience to the world.
            At beginning I was teaching for free and started teaching early in
            the morning 4:30 AM to local students. I always wanted to create
            disciplined Yogis who can spread this discipline of Yoga tradition
            to the World.

            While teaching drop-in classes in Rishikesh I met so many
            practitioners from different parts of the World. Looking at the
            transformation and positive changes in my students, it motivated me
            more to continue my practice and teachings. I was invited by
            numerous yoga schools in Rishikesh to teach Hatha Yoga. During this
            time I taught in Yoga Teacher Training, Workshops, Yoga Festivals,
            Retreats and Health events and seminars in India and abroad. I was
            invited as guest speaker at Yoga Conference by Yoga Journal in
            Russia.

          <p class="text-dark mentor-para">
            During this journey of teachings at different places, I was
            continuously asked to start my own programs for those who want to
            deepen their yoga practices. So I decided to create residential yoga
            school; Yoga Vidya School at Rishikesh in 2016. Yoga Vidya School
            was created with the aim to spread authentic yoga knowledge through
            special Yoga Programs, Yoga Teacher Training, Workshops, Retreats
            and Mind developing practices. In this yoga school, I am
            continuously putting efforts to build a team of dedicated yogis who
            can share the tradition of yoga in its purest form.
